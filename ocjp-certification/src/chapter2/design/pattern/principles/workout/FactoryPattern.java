// PROBLEM: How do we write code that creates objects in which the precise type of the object
// may not be known until runtime?
// SOLUTION: The factory pattern, sometimes referred to as the factory method pattern, is a
// creational pattern based on the idea of using a factory class to produce instances of objects
// based on a set of input parameters. It is similar to the builder pattern, ALTHOUGH IT IS FOCUSED
// ON SUPPORTING CLASS POLYMORPHISM.
