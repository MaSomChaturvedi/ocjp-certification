//
//A collection is a group of objects contained in a single object
//
//■■ List: A list is an ordered collection of elements that ALLOWS DUPLICATE ENTRIES. Elements
//         in a list can be accessed by an int index.
//■■ Set: A set is a collection that DOES NOT ALLOW DUPLICATE ENTRIES.
//■■ Queue: A queue IS A COLLECTION THAT ORDERS ITS ELEMENTS IN A SPECIFIC ORDER FOR PROCESSING.
//          A typical queue processes its elements in a FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT ORDER, but other orderings
//          are possible.
//■■ Map: A map is a collection that maps keys to values, WITH NO DUPLICATE KEYS ALLOWED.
//        The elements in a map are key/value pairs.
//
// NOTICE THAT MAP DOESN’T IMPLEMENT the Collection interface. It is considered part of the Java Collections
// Framework, even though it isn’t technically a Collection. It is a collection (NOTE THE LOWERCASE),
// though, in that it contains a group of objects
